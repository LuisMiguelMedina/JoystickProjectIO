# DevNotes

## In case you didn't get the last DevNotes, we can't use two joysticks because we only have 1 serial communication per operation, this is a hardware limitation so in order to fix this issue we are just going to use another arduino uno (lol).

## Both Keyboard and Mouse HID works great individually, because SOMEONE FORGOT THE ARDUINO IN A FRIDAY we cannot prove that both processes works at the same time, so till monday arrives im going to develop a basic interface for the user so it can change the keyboard values of the joystick (Sounds easy but i just learn python making this project).
