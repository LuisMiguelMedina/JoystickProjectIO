# DevNotes:

## The third attempt was an eye-opener, now we also have an HID for the keyboard and it was way faster than before. This time we don't need cords mapping data interpretation, we just need some basic "if" "else" statement corresponding to joystick axis in order to press some keywords.  Its sounds easy but the actual problem was the project planning, because we think that having all the Pins for the analog Joystick was enought for using two of them, jajaja... *cry*. 

## Now, there is a HUGE deal with COM ports that i didnt mencionate in the second attempt, windows have limitations with the COM reading and writing, so you cant read and write at the same time with the same port (microsoft, why?) so instead of giving a solution I just download a port controller software that resolve it, the software mirrors the COM data in 2 COM ports, the main one is used for writing and the mirrored one is for reading, with this problem """fixed""" we can use python serial library without errors.
